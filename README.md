# Intro to Backbone.js

## SpreeConf Europe 2012

Backbone.js is a small yet powerful javascript library for interacting with RESTful apis, rendering dynamic content, managing routes, and organizing your webapp.

In this training session, we'll go over the basic components of backbone js, show some scenarios where it can be helpful, and even build a (small) client-side application.

## Todo

### Building a Backbone app

* Breakfast roll ingredient database
* I do:
  * Closure w/ App namespace
  * Boot initialization
  * Router to kickstart actions (top-down building)
* We do:
  * Then make the view to handle the route (collection)
  * Then make the collection to populate the view
  * Then make subviews for the models
  * Then make the models
  * Delete model form
  * Create model form
